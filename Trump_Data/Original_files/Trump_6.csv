2020-08-08 22:21:00,"RT @marklevinshow: 1. President Trump had no choice but to issue the Executive Orders this afternoon, and given that Obama instituted DACA without legislation and John Roberts seemed okay with that, the president's DOJ will have strong grounds on which to defend them."
2020-08-08 22:21:00,RT @KurtSchlichter: Why is the DACA executive order a valid thing per SCOTUS but not this?
2020-08-08 22:24:00,RT @hale_razor: Just think of it as DACA for Americans needing relief from unemployment and payroll taxes.
2020-08-08 22:26:00,"RT @drawandstrike: ADDENDUM:

This is 100% correct.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS HIMSELF OPENED UP THE DOOR FOR THIS WITH THAT DACA RULING JUST LAST MONTH.

Remember, TRUMP HIMSELF warned that this gives the President TOO MUCH POWER, if EO's **can't** be reversed by successors.
